# Finishing

## Sanding

Sand the front and sides of the frame and all the buttons.  Work your way up from 100 to 200 to 400 grit sandpaper.  Wet sanding works much better than dry sanding.  Spend most of your time getting rid of all the ridges with the 100 grit paper.

A _carefully_ used dremel with sanding bits can help with the screen recess area.  Go slowly though.  It's really easy to screw up this way.  Finish up the areas that the Dremel can't reach with needle point diamond files.  Be sure to do this before you sand the face.  It's easy to slip and scratch your beautifully smooth face.

Either lightly sand the insides of the button holes or skip them entirely.  I didn't sand them.  If you do, be very careful in the areas where the frame is thin, as it's really easy to overdo it and enlarge the hole.

A random orbital sander will make short work of the frame.  If you don't have one, use a sheet of sandpaper on a glass surface to make sure it's flat.  It will take forever, but the results will be good.

## XTC-3D (Optional)

If you have major defects on the face of the frame that you can't sand out, try XTC-3D after you've rough sanded with 100 grit.  Spread it evenly across the surface, being careful not to let any spill into the button holes.  Wipe any that does get in the button holes with a paper towel.  Also be careful not to use too much inside the screen recess.  It will pool in the corners and mess up the look of the recess.

Wait 12-24 hours for it to cure, and sand it aggressively with 100 grit until you have a smooth, even surface.

## Filler Primer

This step is optional if you used XTC-3D.  Filler primer is great for willing in all the tiny gaps a 3d printer leaves.  Spray 2 light coats on the front and sides of the frame.  Follow the instructions on the can for recoat and drying times.

It's not necessary to use filler primer on the buttons, as you'll be applying decals that will cover up the imperfections.

## Paint

Paint all visible surfaces with matte black spray paint.  Use light coats sprayed from all angles to make sure you cover the insides of the button holes.  It's much better to do multiple light coats instead of heavy coats.

## Decals

Follow the instructions on your pack of waterslide decal transfer paper to print the [decals](../labels.pdf).  Make sure you use a laser printer at the highest detail settings you can.  Also, some laser printers are hotter than others, and may melt the decal paper to the fuser.  Maybe don't do this on your expensive office printer.  Use at your own risk!

Cut out one set of decals with scissors.  Try to get as close to the black edge as you can.  Don't worry if your cut out decals have a bit of white showing on the edges.  We'll touch that up later.

Follow your decal's instructions to apply them  I recommend a pair of fine tweezers, as these things are really tiny.

The decal set has 3x as many as you need just in case you screw up.

Let the decals dry for 4 hours.  Then, take a sharpie and carefully touch up the edges where any white is showing.  Be sure to avoid getting sharpie on the white text though!

## Clear Coat

Apply 1-2 coats of clear coat.  Once it's dry, you're done!
