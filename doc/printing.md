# 3D Printing

I printed my parts using 1.75mm PLA with a 0.4mm nozzle.  I recommend using whatever settings and material gives you the best results on fine details.  There are some pretty fine walls around the circular button area.

## Parts and Instructions

* [1x Frame](../stl/frame.stl): Print face down using supports.
* [1x Circular Button](../stl/circle_button.stl): Print face down, no supports.
* [5x Arc Buttons](../stl/arc_button.stl): Print face down, no supports.
* [14x Rectangular Buttons](../stl/rec_button.stl): Print face down, no supports.

## Optional Parts

* [1x Button Guide](../stl/guide.stl): This part can be used to ensure that the buttons are soldered on perfectly straight.  This will ensure that the button caps move freely and don't bind on the frame.
